# Project_Fertility_Rate

The global average fertility rate is just below 2.5 children per woman today. Over the last 50 years the global fertility rate has halved. And over the course of the modernization of societies the number of children per woman decreases very substantially.

This is a study of fertility rate by country between 1960, 1980, 2000, and 2016.

The fertility rate of a country is a figure that reflects the number of children a woman would give birth to under two conditions: the woman were to experience age-specific fertility rates and if the woman were to survive through her reproductive child-bearing years. Statistically, this means ages 15 to 44, or in some cases, ages 15 to 49. The fertility rate isn’t a measure of how many children each woman in a specific area has. Instead, it’s based on the average number that a woman could potentially have. This is also known as “total fertility rate.”

In this project,  I explored the trend on fertility rates by different countries through the methods of data analysis. 

To do this, the World Bank Dataset from United Nations Population Division was used to analyze and visulize.

Need to run on http server (python app1.py)

Specific Requirements

The visualization project include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
