# Project_Fertility_Rate

The global average fertility rate is just below 2.5 children per woman today. Over the last 50 years the global fertility rate has halved. And over the course of the modernization of societies the number of children per woman decreases very substantially.

In this project,  I explored the trend on fertility rates by different countries through the methods of data analysis. 

To do this, the World Bank Dataset from United Nations Population Division was used to analyze and visulize.
